# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Usually pretty accurate, however there were one or two times when I serverly underestimated the
time required for more challenging tasks.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I don't think it did.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

Expect things to take longer than expected.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I wouldn't say I learned anything specific, rather my reviewers often pointed out code that could be improved. This
kind of feedback helped me generally improve my code quality.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Other people often had different solutions that were sometimes better than my own. Understanding other peoples
solutions led me to understand how I could approach problems differently and how I could improve. Reviewing
other peoples code also forced me to read code that I did not write myself. This improved my ability to interpret
code whether it be my own, or someone else's.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 8](https://github.com/ShutongChen9/cp1404practicals/pull/6)

### Explanation

This review taught me the most as the code had the most mistakes and therefore required me to really understand 
it before providing feedback. Not only did I need to apply and justify my own improvements, but also understand
the code in order to not falsely assert code as incorrect.


### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 9](https://github.com/JD-113/cp1404practicals/pull/6)

### Explanation

This review had less comments as there were few mistakes, however it still required me to debug someone else's
code and suggest an improvement to the name of a method. This obviously allowed me to practice debugging with
the added complexity of it being someone else's code.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

It took me a while to understand exactly what I was being marked on. I'm not sure if it is just because I am in 
engineering and not CS, but for quite a while I did not understand how important comments, naming, functions, 
commit history, etc... were. I would have found it useful if the mark allocation was better explained.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I think I did well at creating working code that was usually well designed. I picked up new concepts easily as I had seen most of them in other languages before.
